# Machine-learning-Sentimental-Analysis-on-IMDB-Movie-Reviews
Leveraged Data Mining, Machine Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Natural Language Processing for reliable sentiment classification of unstructured movie reviews.

**ABSTRACT:**
This case study aims to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on sentiment using machine learning techniques. The main objectives are to analyse the sentiment distribution in IMDb movie reviews, preprocess the text data using natural language processing techniques, and train various classification models. The case study utilizes a dataset of 320,000 movie reviews, annotated by reviewers in 10 classes, along with other relevant data. The methods involve converting the text data into a numerical representation, exploring different machine learning models, and evaluating their performance. The expected outcomes include insights into the sentiment distribution of movie reviews, the identification of the best performing classification model, and the potential for movie studios to automate sentiment analysis for decision-making processes. This case study contributes to the field by showcasing the application of natural language processing and machine learning in sentiment analysis for unstructured text data.
